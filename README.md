**Company:** Cash App

**Founders:** Bob Lee, Jack Dorsey, Jim McKelvey, Square, Inc. (now Block, Inc.)

**Origin:** Cash App wanted to compete as a peer to peer transfer app and then expand itself into many other sectors such as crypto, investments etc.

In 2017, their revenue was $2.2 billion which grew to $3.3 billion in 2018. The market cap as of Q1 in 2022 is $78.5 billion. 

## Business Activities
Cash App is trying to be the one stop show for individuals who want to manage their bank accounts, invest in stocks, engage in cryptocurreny trading and make payments directly to businesses. 

The intended consumer can be anyone who would like a simple, easy to use app on the go for any of the above services which also includes filing taxes now.
Historically speaking, "Unbanked and Underbanked communites" used Cash App the most since it offered them a means of having a personal bank account. 
According to DigitalNative, Cash App is the top financial application offered on the App Store and has been for numerous years totalling 80 million users and has surpassed that by now since the article came out in 2022.

Cash App, again, is a one stop shop for any individual that wants to have a bank account, invest in stocks and access options to get into crypto trading. Something that they utilized that no other app did at the time was the app was made to be a social media app essentially. What I mean by this is that you can connect to businesses, other individuals etc. with ease to make peer to peer transactions, payments, filing taxes and all with a few taps on your device. In this day and age, social media is king and Cash App capitalized on that and soared to the number one spot of financial applications. Cash App also offers a debit card now that one can use in physical locations for payments, withdrawing funds from an ATM etc. 
According to Listerhill Credit Union, the advantages of using this app to reiterate are as follows: Instant payments, send/receive payments for free, splitting bills, direct deposits, free debit card, withrawing funds from and ATM, no account fees, bill pay, free stock trading and crypto selling.
The unfair advantage is that again, Cash App is a one stop shop for all your financial needs. It combines everything into one app that adds convenience that no other app has. According to the Crunchbase profile, "Cash App is the fastest growing financial brand in the world."

The technologies used by Cash App provided by Stack Share are: HTML5, Google Fonts, Google Tag Manager, SQLDelight, CrashKiOS from TouchLab, Javascript, Bitcoin Network blockchain, Ruby, Java, Amazon EC2, Swift, Airflow, Ember.js, Snowflake, Vertica

## Landscape

Cash App actually has it's hands in multiple domains. The main ones that are used in the app are Payments/Billing, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, Capital Investment, Wealth Management, Personal Finance and Open Banking. You can argue that since it is essentially your own bank account as well, it also is considered a part of the Investment Management domain. 

From the start, Cash App actually lost money when people signed up to be a part of the service. Since then they have improved their monetary gains with the introduction of Cashtags and allowing people to actually hold money. Accoriding to BusinessofApps, Square now makes over $30 per person that signs up. This made the app very competitive against others in the same field. Since the introduction of the app, they have incorporated more and more avenues for people to make money via investing and stock trading and Bitcoin trading which has propelled the apps revenue significantly. Again, this is the only app that has utilized so many domains in one app, thus allowing people to conveniently manage money, invest, file taxes, send and receive money along with many more features. Furthermore, social media definitely influenced the apps dominance by recruiting famous artists to promote and basically hand out money to fans as giveaways which really caused the boom in monthly users that the app is experiencing to date.

Cash App has numerous competetors such as: Google Pay, Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, Apple Pay, Wise, Xoom, Robinhood etc.
"It's clear that Square wants Cash App to be more than simple payment tool, but a hub for all financial interests." -BusinessofApps

## Results
**Impact:**

To reiterate the usage statistics, the app itself is experiencing growth that is continuously growing year after year.

Based on the above data, one can conclude that Cash App is continually rising the ranks from usage, net profit and gross profit overall thus proving that the business impact of this company is quite large.

*All of the above data was collected by BusinessofApps*

The simplest metric one can use to determine success is just simply the amount of downloads Cash App has vs its competitors. AppMagic stated that "Cash App has been downloaded by 36M+ people in the US so far this year. That almost matches Venmo's and PayPal's downloads combined." [AppMagic Stats]([AppMagic Stats](https://appmagic.rocks/dashboards/637c82a880ae5?promoCode=63e0fc7fb0909))

FinnModelsLab outlines perfectly the metrics that most fintech companies use aka KPI's (key performance indicators). These include Revenue Growth, Customer Acquisition Cost, Monthly Active Users, Retention Rate, Market Share, Cost of Goods Sold and Cash Flow. Based on this outline and comparing data to Cash Apps competitor's which we already discussed, it clearly shows that Cash App is dominating the industry right now and is not slowing down. (see charts above for reiterating this point.)

In comparison to the competition, not only does Cash App have more downloads than them but monthly users are on the rise as well. 
To reiterate previous statements, it is the number one finance app in the app store and has been for years now. It is the 8th most downloaded app in 2021. DigitalNative put it best when they stated, "Cash App surpassed Venmo in total users, and over the past four years, the gap has widened." This is due to viral marketing strategies that Cash App has use

Here is a quick summary of what exactly has happened since the beginning of Cash App and the broadened reach and exponential growth the app has had.

## Recommendations

Basing my judgement on all the research provided above, if there is a company out there looking to mimic the growth of Cash App and it's dominance in fintech, I would highly suggest not only allowing peer to peer transactions but also incorporating a large variety of ways that individuals can use the app for multiple domains in FinTech. Albeit, it would be copying what Cash App has done, it seems the only way to mimic this is to allow Bitcoin trading, Stock Trading, Wealth Management, Tax Filing and even more social aspects that led to the rise of Cash App itself. You need to be able to combine every personal finance need in one place but also make it consumer friendly and easy to use. One thing that was noticed in the research done was that one of the ways to be profitable is lowering acquisition cost of users. DigitalNative shows a great example where Cash App has a $10 acquisition cost vs NeoBanks ($30-$50) and Retail Banks ($300-$600).

Some cons of using Cash App accoding to Findabetterbank.com include a low limit for transactions in the first month and no international use outside of the US and UK (yet). This would be something to consider offering if you are a start up or a competitor to Cash App. Allowing funds to be FDIC insured would draw more attention from established individuals that use Retal Banks. If you were to include international use, you would most likely exponentially increase your reach to nations outside of the US and UK thus bringing in a plethora of nationalities to use your app for transactions and trading. 

To incorporate these additions you would need to use technologies that can monitor worldwide transactions. For example, Western Union implements technologies that allow its reach to be worldwide. If a company could include this in their application, the reach you could have with your FinTech app not only becomes exponentially larger but you can monitor transactions making them safe to do globally. Some of these technologies include but are not limited to: AI and ML, Blockchain, Cloud Computing, IoT, Swift.

These technologies are appropriate for this solution since they are already implemented in Western Union which already does global peer to peer trasactions that are not offered by apps like Cash App.
